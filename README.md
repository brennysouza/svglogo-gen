# SVG LOGO GENERATOR
The following application is a logo generator for a simple, minimal, and effective logo for any user. 

## Description
This is a back end application that users must access with node.js. A prompt is opened and users have to answer a few simple questions in order to tailor the perfect svg logo they desire. Users have the option of typing in a monogram of three characters, choosing any color for the monogram, choosing three shapes: triangle, circle, or square, and choosing a color for the shape. Once prompt is finished, a message will display saying, "generated svg logo." Users can then access their new logo within the examples folder and open in live server should they desire to. 

## Installation
Users should open the index.js file inside their local machine, open a new terminal, run npm i, run node index.js, and proceed to answer questions that will show in terminal.

Users can run test by running npm test in the shapes.test.js integrated terminal.
